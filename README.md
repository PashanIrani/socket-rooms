# Socket-Rooms
A simple client and server side library to simplify handling rooms in socket.io.

## Planned Features ðŸ”­
* Easily Join and Leave rooms.
* Room restrictions (Limited Room sizes, passwords)
* Broadcast messages within room
* and more...

## Usage

### Server Setup

1. Initialize socket.io server:
```
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
const io = new Server(/* Ensure the options here are set correct for socket.io work */);
```
View [socket.io docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-initialization/#initialization) for socket.io server initialization.

2. Provide Socket-Rooms with initialized **socket.io** instace:
```
const { SocketRoomsServer } = require('socket-rooms');
SocketRoomsServer.init(io);
```

### Client Setup
1. Initialize socket.io:
```
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
```

2. Initialize socket-rooms:

#### ES Modules
```
import { SocketRoomsClient } from 'socket-rooms';

SocketRoomsClient.init(io()).then(() => {
  // Can now perform socket-rooms functions
});
```

#### `<script>` import
```
<script src="/socket-rooms/Client.js"></script>
```
```
SocketRoomsClient.init(io()).then(() => {
  // Can now perform socket-rooms functions
});
```
